# beerbuddy

BeerBuddy is a social network site that I've built during my time at coding bootcamp. Users can register, edit their profiles, upload an avatar and send friend requests to other users. Passwords are hashed before storing and avatar images are stored on AWS.

By visiting a friends' profile, users see their friends. Other online users are displayed and there is a search function to look for other profiles. The site also has a public chat room.

Node, Express, React, Redux, Socket.io, AWS
