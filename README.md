# beerbuddy

BeerBuddy is a social network site that I've built during my time at coding bootcamp. Users can register, edit their profiles, upload an avatar and send friend requests to other users. By visiting another user's profile, they can see friends of friends. There is a search function to find other users. The site also has a public chat room.

Tech:
Node, Express, React, Redux, Socket.io
